      `Marina has helped our team with a couple of projects and it's always been great to work with her. She has a great sense of current trends and her own artistic flair, I really liked seeing the unique spins she put on our projects. Whenever she delivered an early cut the clients had very few notes and projects finished ahead of schedule. 
      \nPerhaps more importantly, I was impressed with the speed she worked at. Our whole team got along with her well and we would gladly work with her more in the future.`,
